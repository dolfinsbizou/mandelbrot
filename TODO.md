* Name research:
    * "What will it do?" Yet another escape time fractals visualization tool
    * "Who will use it" I will once then I'll never use it again 'cuz it will be damn slow 'cause it's shit and someone on the Internet already did it a thousand times better than I
    * "Why should they use it" Because fractals are dope
    * "How do I tell them what it is in 3 sentences?" It's a fractal generator. Fractals are dope. Generate fractals.
    * "In 3 words?" Fractals are cool.
    * Now I must find if somewhere in mythology exists a god of fractals.
